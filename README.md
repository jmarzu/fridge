## What's in your fridge?

Have you ever stood in front of your fridge and didn't know what to eat? The fridge might have food in it, but still nothing comes to mind. The **fridge** app is the answer to all your recipe questions. 

Just enter the ingredients in the **fridge** search bar and receive the best recipes the web can offer. 

## Motivation

I was standing in front of my **fridge** one evening after work and had no idea what to eat with the food in **fridge**. I thought to myself, "I wish I had an app for that!". Now I do have an app for that. **fridge**
